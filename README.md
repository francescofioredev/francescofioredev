# Hi, I’m Francesco 👋

I'm a computer engineer with over 6 years of experience crafting enterprise-grade, cloud-native solutions. By day, I work as a Senior Software Engineer at Fincons Group, helping enterprise clients tackle mission-critical projects. In my spare time, I'm the CTO and co-founder of The Niksen Company, an AI-driven startup dedicated to enhancing digital wellbeing.

My passion lies in designing robust software architectures, automating workflows with DevOps, and building scalable products that genuinely simplify people's lives. I've gained extensive experience across microservices, backend development, cloud infrastructure (AWS), API design, and mobile development using cutting-edge tech such as Python, FastAPI, and React Native.

🔧 **Preferred stack:** FastAPI, MongoDB, DynamoDB, AWS (Terraform IaC), GitHub Actions, Docker, React Native

🎯 **Goal:** Deliver elegant, sustainable, and impactful solutions combining top-notch performance, scalability, and tangible user value.
